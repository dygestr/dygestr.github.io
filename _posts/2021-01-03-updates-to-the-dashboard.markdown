Worked on updating the dashboard today, previously if a user had not entered any entries if they went to the dashboard tab it would throw an error and crash because it did not have any data to add into the chart, I have fixed up the dashboard so that it checks first if there are any valid entries before trying to generate a chart.

I have also added horizontal grid lines to the stool and medication charts so it's easier to differentiate each entry :

Welcome to the Dygestr Digestion Tracker home page. This website will be about digestive health and will aim to provide status updates on the [Dygestr digestive health tracker]().

This application will allow users to track their food intake, digestive health and medication and provide users with a dashboard and the ability to export and save their data.

If you want to send me an email, please email us at [dygestr@gmail.com](mailto://dygestr@gmail.com)

The source code for the Dygestr app is being hosted on GitHub at <https://github.com/dygestr/dygestr>

I have also enabled [Discussions](https://github.com/dygestr/dygestr/discussions) and [Issues](https://github.com/dygestr/dygestr/issues) on the repository in case any one wants to help contribute to the project. There's also a [Wiki](https://github.com/dygestr/dygestr/wiki) that we may update with information.

I aim to write this application in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and use the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework and use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) for the dashboard charts.
